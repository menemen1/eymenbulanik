                        <p>Hi! I'm Eymen BULANIK, born June 19, 2008, and currently a student at Hatay Bahçeşehir Science and Technology High School on a 60% academic scholarship. I'm pursuing the Science-Mathematics track with a passion for robotics, technology, and music.</p>
                        <p>As a team leader in multiple robotics competitions including Robotex and Fibonacci International, I've led my teams to achieve 2nd place in international competitions. I'm also the head of PR for our FRC team and co-founded an Instagram page for our robotics team.</p>
                        <p>Music has been a significant part of my life since 5th grade - I'm a professional pianist and also play drums, guitar, and ukulele. I've performed in numerous school concerts and events, using my musical talents for community service and fundraising.</p>
                        <p>I'm deeply committed to community service, having organized concerts and events to help earthquake victims, volunteered with children with cancer, and participated in various charitable activities. I believe in using my talents and skills to make a positive impact in my community.</p>
